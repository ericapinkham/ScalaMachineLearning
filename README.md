# ScalaMachineLearning
This repo contains my attempt to implement various algorithms presented in Christopher M. Bishop's book, "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning." All the algorithms will be implemented in a purely functional way without reliance on external packages. This is an attempt to learn Scala and functional programming.
